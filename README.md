# PackUBIEST

This project is based on the Linkit One board, taking advantage of its capabilities to build a GPS tracker that works on SMS and GPRS communication, while running on batteries to be a completely independent device.

It is part of a greater project, PackCTRL: a backpack with extended capabilitites, being a GPS tracker one of them.
